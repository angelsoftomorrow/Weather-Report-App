# Weather-Report-App
Weather App programed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using OpenWeatherAPI

For JavaScript, the code will ask for the date from the API and afterwards, will feed it into the HTML file for display. For changing the temperatures, it will request the input from the user via a toggle option and afterwards will convert the temperature from either Celsius or Farenheit.

For the daily forecast, while originally, an array-like implementation was going to be chosen, an implementation instead featuring slicing was used for a simpler approach.
